👤 About Me

My primary focus today is the crypto space, but my Harmonic Flow of Energy framework works anywhere there’s volume, momentum and structure.

## 🧩 My Proprietary Framework & Algorithm

At the heart of my approach lies a balance of technical rigor and mindful observation. I process raw market data into high‑confidence signals:

1. **Flow**  
   – *“Who leads the movement?”*  
   Every candlestick, every volume spike carries an energetic signature. We observe, we don’t guess.

2. **Harmony**  
   – *“Is price, volume & structure aligned?”*  
   Trade only when the components sing in unison. Discord signals pause.

3. **Proportions**  
   – *“Length, time & force matter.”*  
   Impulse vs. retracement, wide vs. narrow range—each ratio tells a story.

4. **Context**  
   – *“No signal stands alone.”*  
   A breakout on 15 m is meaningless if the daily trend contradicts it.

5. **Calm**  
   – *“Clear flow brings clear action.”*  
   When the mind is still, decisions emerge naturally—no FOMO, no panic.
